# CVWO_Web_Forum
This project aims to build a simple web forum similar to Reddit, where users can create topics, post content, and comment on posts. The application focuses on clarity, maintainability, and correctness rather than feature complexity. Users will log in using a username-only authentication model, similar to platforms such as when2meet.
